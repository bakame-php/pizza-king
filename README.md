Pizza King

This is a fork of [mnapoli/ pizza-king](https://github.com/mnapoli/pizza-king)

This is a raw translation of the exercise in english:

> My name is Jean-Michel and I make pizzas in my pizzeria.
>
> In my pizzeria, customers can compose pizzas.
>
> And I need to digitize the composition of pizzas (necessarily).
>
> The application will allow me to make sure that only valid pizzas are created, 
>
> and to calculate the price of a pizza.
>
> Here are the rules for composing pizzas:
>
> - a pizza must have a sauce: tomato or cream.
> - a pizza must have a cheese: mozzarella or goat cheese.
> - a pizza has 0, 1 or 2 meats: ham and/or pepperoni and/or nothing.
>
> Here is the price of the ingredients:
>
> - basic price of a pizza : 4 €.
> - tomato sauce : 1 €
> - cream sauce : 1 €.
> - mozzarella : 3 €.
> - goat : 2 €.
> - ham : 2 €.
> - pepperoni : 4 €.
>
> It turns out that the pizzeria's customers are PHP developers.
> They will place an order via a PHP script, calling the necessary classes and/or functions.
> Pizzeria 2.0!
>
> Constraints :
>
> - you are not allowed to use a server database, like MySQL (because my cousin told me it's not web-scale)
> - no need to do a web UI or CLI
>
> Objective :
>
> - use the maximum of PHP 8 unique features (my cousin told me it was better)
